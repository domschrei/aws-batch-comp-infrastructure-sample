# SAT-Comp and SMT-Comp Cloud Track Instructions

This repository will help you get your parallel or distributed solver running efficiently on AWS.  You will build docker containers with your solver and then connect them to the AWS infrastructure.

We recommend that you work in four steps:

1. Create and configure an AWS Account for the competition.  Please do this right away and send us an email, so we can start the process to give you AWS credits.  You can then continue with step 2 while waiting for us to answer. 
2. Build your solver as a Docker image and run experiments locally.
3. Set up AWS infrastructure and test your solver on the cloud.
4. When ready, share the solver repository and Docker image with us.

We describe step 1 in this document.  Step 2 is described in the [Solver Development README](docker/README-Solver-Development.md), while steps 3 and 4 are described in the [Infrastructure README](infrastructure/README-Infrastructure.md). 


## Creating an AWS Account

First, create a specific AWS account for the competition. If you have not created an AWS account previously, it is straightforward to do, requiring a cell phone number, credit card, and address. Make sure to register your account with an institutional email address (and not a private one), otherwise AWS cannot sponsor your account. To create an account, navigate to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and follow the instructions.

If you have previously created an AWS account, we strongly advise that you create a separate AWS account for managing the SAT/SMT-Comp tool construction and testing. This makes it much easier for us to manage account credits and billing. Once the new account is created, email us the account number at: sat-comp@amazon.com (for SAT-Comp) or aws-smtcomp-2023@googlegroups.com (for SMT-Comp) and we will apply the appropriate credits to your account.

To find your account ID, click on your account name in the top right corner, and then click "My Account". You should see Account ID in the Account Settings

It is important that you tell us your account number immediately after creating the account, so that we can assign you a resource budget for your experiments. We also need to grant you access to the shared problem sets. Once we hear from you, we will email you an acknowledgment when resources have been added to your account.  

## Building Your Solver

Next, it is time to develop your solver!  All of the development and most of the testing can be performed on a local laptop, so it is not necessary to wait for AWS credits to get started.  Please look at the instructions in the [Solver Development README](docker/README-Solver-Development.md) on how to start building and testing your solver.

## For Returning Competitors:
We have worked hard to improve the developer experience.  As compared with the 2022 infrastructure, we have added or modified: 

1. Scripts and instructions for local debugging of both parallel and distributed solvers on your workstation/laptop.
1. Automated upload of stdout/stderr and intermediate files for each run to S3 storage so that you can  debug runs after completion.
1. A "quickstart" that allows you to build the infrastructure and solver, then run it using only two commands.
1. Default values for most of the required arguments from 2022 to make it much simpler to run commands.
1. A richer `input.json` format that is used for solver communication that allows passing arguments to solvers, a timeout, and information about the input format.
1. A change in the expected solver output format in `solver_out.json`. This year, the satisfiability/unsatisfiability of the problem is indicated by the return code of the solver (10 for SAT, 20 for UNSAT)
1. Various improvements and bug fixes in the scripts for building/running jobs to provide better observability of the process.

Note that the changes to `input.json` and `solver_out.json` are breaking changes for solvers, described in more detail in [README-changes.md](README-changes.md).  The changes should require only a short effort to update for 2023.

## Additional Resources: Analysis Problems

The SAT problems for the SAT-Comp 2022 competition are available [here](https://satcompetition.github.io/2022/downloads.html).  The SMT problems for SMT-Comp 2022 competition are available [here](https://smt-comp.github.io/2022/benchmarks.html).

## Additional Resources: Solvers

Here are github repositories for the solvers from the 2022 competitions.  **Please Note:** the 
infrastructure for 2023 is slightly changed to facilitate better debugging and easier build.  In order to run these solvers on the current infrastructure, you must update `input.json` and `solver_out.json` as described in [README-changes.md](README-changes.md).

## FAQ

#### I already created my AWS account with a non-institutional email address. Can I still change the email address tied to my account?

Yes. To change your email address, follow the instructions at https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/change-email-address.
